# RedshiftConfig

I decided to make this utility because last year every time we wanted to change servo positions, motor speeds, we had to reupload the code to the phone. The main goal for my project was to make it user friendly. For every OPMode you can make a config. In each config you define static variables for the motor speeds, servo positions etc. Then all you half to do is run that config and it will prompt you how to configure everything.
